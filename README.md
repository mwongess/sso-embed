[//]: # (---)

[//]: # (Embedding Looker involves displaying and interacting with Looker content from an outside source, such as the users website or in a third party SAS solution from another vendor. This offers a way to seemlessly leverage the power of Looker to enhance a third party product and / or offer a secure method for an outside user to interact with the data provided. )

## Installation (local)

---

1. Clone or download a copy of this template to your development machine.
2. Navigate (cd) to the template directory on your system.
3. Set the environmental variables.

   - This is set with the Property File **application.yml** located in **./main/resources**.
     There is a sample file **application-example.yml** with instructions in the same location.
     Instead of adding variables to the file, these variables may be set as environment variables.

4. From the project directory (that contains the pom.xml file), set up a Maven Wrapper for the project.
   https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/
   - `mvn -N wrapper:wrapper`
5. Run the project.
   - `./mvnw spring-boot:run `
6. The server should be up and running locally! It can be tested by navigating to `localhost:3000/api/me` (or whichever server port is set as an environmental variable in application.yml).


## Google AppEngine Installation (optional)

---

Google [AppEngine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) offers a fully managed and highly scalable cloud based host for both the backend and frontend processes when moving beyound local testing. Free credits are offered for new accounts and a number of free hours are offered to current customers.

### To get started:

- Install Googleâ€™s Cloud SDK including gcloud (the primary CLI used to manage Google Cloud resources [link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud))

- Initialize gcloud and choose / create a Google Cloud project ([link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing))

  ```
  gcloud init
  ```

  ***

  ### A Note re: Security

  Before deploying the code to AppEngine it is advised to consider the potential issues of publishing to a public endpoint. Unless this involves a test instance of Looker with non-sensitive data, we will need to protect the endpoint from unauthorized use.

  One option is to configure the Firewall rules as to only allow access from your IP address.

  - To do this:
    - Make sure the project is selected in the AppEngine Dashboard.
    - Select **Firewall rules** from the left navigation menu.
    - Select the **default** rule, click **edit**, and select **Deny** for range \* and then **Save**.
    - The click **Create Rule** on the top navigation menu.
    - Enter 10 for **Priority**, select **Allow**, and enter your IP address in the IP Range box. Click **Save**.

    <br>

- Update the `api/src/main/resources/application.yml` file, and create a Maven Wrapper for the project, the same way as described in the local installation instructions.

- Install dependencies and create a new build to deploy to App Engine:

  ```
  yarn install
  yarn run build
  ```

- In `api/src/main/resources/application.yml` update the server port to 8080:

  ```
  server:
    port: 8080
  ```

- Update `pom.xml` to include a Maven Google Cloud plugin that simplifies the deployment process.

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" ...>
   ...
   <build>
      <plugins>
         ...
         <plugin>
         <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
         <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
         <version>2.2.0</version>
         <configuration>
            <version>1</version>
            <projectId>GCLOUD_CONFIG</projectId>
         </configuration>
         </plugin>
      </plugins>
   </build>
   ...
   </project>
  ```

- From the root `Backend-Java` directory, deploy the Spring Boot application too App Engine as an API service:

  ```
  ./mvnw -DskipTests package appengine:deploy
  ```

- Note the target url. When deploy completes, test by pointing browser to:

  ```
  {target-url}/api/me
  ```

- Now we will need to return and modify the **client** .env file with the {target-url} created for the API.

  - Update: <b>API_HOST</b> to point to the target-url returned during the API Deploy above

  - Update: <b>PBL_CLIENT_PORT</b> to 80

- Upload the client code/service with:

  ```
  gcloud app deploy client.yaml dispatch.yaml
  ```
